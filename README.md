# About Mana

Mana is a CRUD app that helps you create and track a daily practice. Simply give your practice a name, choose how many successful days you want to track, what days of the week you want to do your practice on, and the app will conditionally render the right practices on the page based on todays weekday.

This app tracks successful days for each individual practice. Once you've finished a practice for the day, select the check box and it will be marked complete.
